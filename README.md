# Hararchy

## Name Explanation

**Omarchy** is a blend of "omakase" (a menu-less Japanese restaurant experience) and "Arch" (Arch Linux). The original name is a cultural appropriation from someone who has only experienced Japanese culture through a snobbish Malibu restaurant.

**Hara** is the center of life in the human body according to Japanese tradition. The name "Hararchy" reflects a return to core values and authenticity, both in culture and in software.

This project is a **fork of the Omarchy distribution**. The main goal is to remove the commercial nonsense introduced by DHH (Omarchy/Hey, Basecamp) and restore a truly developer-focused, opinionated environment for modern Linux users.

## What is Hararchy?

Hararchy turns a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland, with a single command. Unlike upstream Omarchy, Hararchy:

- **Removes commercial branding and Basecamp/Hey integrations**
- **Focuses on developer essentials and productivity**
- **Adds missing tools and packages for opinionated developers** (see `install/omarchy-other.packages` for details)
- **Keeps configs clean, open, and hackable**

No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Hararchy is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its bestâ€”without the commercial baggage.
